**PhysUniBench: An Undergraduate-Level Physics Reasoning Benchmark for Multimodal Models**

PhysUniBench is a large-scale multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the advanced reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on undergraduate-level physics problems. It provides a challenging and diagnostic dataset that reflects the complexity and multimodal nature of real-world scientific problem solving.

## Key Features

- **3304 total physics problems**, all paired with diagrams:
  - **2057 open-ended QA questions**
  - **1247 multiple-choice questions (MCQs)**

- **Multimodal format**: Each problem includes an image + textual context.

- Covers **8 major subfields** of undergraduate physics:
  1. Electromagnetism & Electrodynamics  
  2. Classical Mechanics  
  3. Optics  
  4. Atomic, Molecular, and Subatomic Physics  
  5. Relativity  
  6. Solid-State Physics and Measurement  
  7. Thermodynamics  
  8. Quantum Mechanics

- All problems annotated with a difficulty level from 1 to 5.

## Benchmark Structure

PhysUniBench is split into:
- `benchmark/`: Code for loading and evaluating data.
- `models/`: Unified model APIs and judge functions.
- `results_*/`: Cached results and evaluation logs.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and expression matching.

We recommend starting from the evaluation scripts inside `script/` if you want to test new models.
